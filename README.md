# Model W Directory

The goal of Model W is to be able to unify a web agency's software stack by
making choices on the infrastructure configuration, the frameworks to use and
each piece of software's version.

This is a set of packages and documentation that is updated quarterly in order
to drive the update cycle of various projects.
