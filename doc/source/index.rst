Welcome to Model W
==================

Model W is the standard application architecture from
WITH Madrid. As we work on many different projects,
the aim is to provide a unified platform that solves common problems in order
to allow developers to focus on added-value.

You'll find in this documentation an overview of Model W along with references
to the various packages that we publish.

.. note::

    You should definitely read about the :doc:`Prerequisites <prerequisites>`
    before you start.

.. note::

   Model W is inspired by Model T. You can use any stack you want as long as
   it's the one in Model W. The "W" is obviously the "W" from WITH.
